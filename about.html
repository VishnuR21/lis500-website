            Our perspectives on technology and responsibility.
          </h1>
          <p>
            We’re both interested in how technology shapes people’s lives in
            visibly and invisibly. The bias test and readings helped both of us
            notice how fast unconscious associations can show up and why
            intersectionality matters when evaluating technology’s impact.

            <p>
              <strong>Intro:</strong> I’m a junior at UW–Madison majoring in
              Computer Science, Data Science, and Information Science. I’m
              interested in how technology shapes everyday life, especially how
              algorithms and data systems affect real people. I took LIS 500 to
              better understand the social impact of the systems I help build.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Background & interests:</strong> Outside of class I like
              building side projects, playing guitar, going to the gym, reading,
              and cooking. As someone who wants to work in tech long term, I
              think it’s important to not just know how to code, but also to
              think about power, bias, and responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Learning goals for LIS 500:</strong> Understand how bias
              shows up in data systems, connect course ideas to real-world tech
              impacts, and learn how to design more responsible tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Favorite tech & inspiration:</strong> I’m fascinated by
              modern AI tools and their power to generate text and automate
              tasks. A tech figure who inspires me is Tim Berners‑Lee for his
              idea that the web should be open and accessible to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>IAT reflection:</strong> I took the race IAT. It felt like
              a fast-paced sorting game and made me think about how quickly our
              brains make associations, even when we are not fully aware of
              them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Intersectionality:</strong> People’s experiences are
              shaped by overlapping identities (race, gender, class, and more).
              The readings and IAT helped me see that bias isn’t just about one
              category at a time.

            <p>
              <strong>Intro:</strong> I’m studying Neurobiology and Information
              Science. I took LIS 500 because I’m interested in how technology
              affects people in ways we don’t always notice right away.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Background & interests:</strong> I like learning across
              different areas and thinking about how systems are designed, who
              they’re built for, and who might be unintentionally left out.
              Outside of class, I spend a lot of time walking, doing Pilates,
              reading, watching long-running TV shows, and singing, which helps
              me balance how busy school can feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Learning goals for LIS 500:</strong> Notice hidden impacts
              of technology, understand how bias shows up in systems, and
              connect course ideas to design decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>IAT reflection:</strong> Taking the bias test felt
              uncomfortable but eye-opening. It highlighted how quickly our
              brains make associations without conscious awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Intersectionality:</strong> People experience bias and
              privilege through overlapping identities. The test and readings
              reinforced that these layers matter, especially in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tech & impact reflection:</strong> Small design choices
              can shape access and fairness. This experience made me more
              intentional about questioning systems rather than accepting them
              as neutral.
