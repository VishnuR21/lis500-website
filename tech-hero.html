        <p>
          Tim Berners-Lee is the computer scientist who invented the World Wide
          Web. In 1989, while working at CERN, he came up with the idea of
          linking and sharing information across different computers. He created
          the first web browser and web server, and he made the main web
          technologies like HTML and HTTP free for anyone to use. Because he
          chose not to keep it private or charge for it, people all over the
          world were able to build websites and contribute to the internet as we
          know it.
        </p>
        <p>
          His leadership matters for equity because keeping the web open lowered
          barriers to entry. Schools, small organizations, and individuals did
          not need special permission or large amounts of money to create
          something online. He also started the World Wide Web Consortium, which
          brings together different groups to agree on web standards. This helps
          make sure the web works across devices and for different communities,
          instead of being controlled by just one company.
        </p>
        <p>
          More recently, Berners-Lee has spoken out about how much power and
          personal data are now controlled by a small number of companies. He
          has argued that the web should give users more control over their own
          information and better protect privacy. Through projects like Solid,
          he has focused on the idea that people should own their data and
          decide who can access it. In a class like LIS 500, he is a good
          example of how design choices in technology can either open access and
          spread power more evenly, or concentrate power in the hands of a few.
